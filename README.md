# Salary Prediction

Use a linear regression to predict the salary based on the experience.

This dataset is a simplified version of [Salary Data Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data).

**This data is not taking into account some precious insights like: Sex, Degree or Role. This data is just to have fun**

## Running

To run this, you'll need to have installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

Then, run `python3 main.py`

You can also specify the amount of experience by passing as a parameter like that: `python3 main.py 10`
